G-fahrenheit.py: Using input function to input a fahrenheit temperature and assign it to a variable, using round 
                 function to round off the result(celcius temperature) computed according to the relationship between
                 fahrenheit and celcius.

G-interest.py: Using input function to input savings and interest and assign them to variables seperately, and then 
               compute the savings after 5 years according to the relationship between them and print the result.

G-area.py: Using input function to input a radius of a circle and assign it to a variable, and then compute the area of 
        the circle according to the relation between area and radius. The result is rounded off with 1 decimal by using
        round function.          

G-time.py: Using input function to input a number of seconds and assign it a variable. Using integer division and modulus
        to convert given seconds to the same amount of hours, minutes and seconds and print the result.

VG-sumofthree.py: Using input function to input a three digits number and extract the three digits seprately by using 
               integer division and modulus, and compute the sum of three numbers then assign it to a variable, Finally
               print it. 

VG-change.py: Using input function to input price and payment to compute the change, then using round function to round 
           it off. Using integer division and/or modulus to extract the minimum number of Swedish bills 
           and coins returned to nearest kr, finally print the results.

G-largest.py: Using input function to input three numbers seperately and assign them to variables, Using boolean 
           expressions(comparison operators and logic operators) to find the largest number and print it.

G-oddpositive.py: Using random module imported from the library and generate a random number in the given range.
                  Using boolean expression and integer modulus to classify the number is odd or even and positive 
                  or negative.

G-shortname.py: Using input function to input first name and last name and assign them to variables, using string 
                indexing to extract particular characters and print them.

VG-tax.py: Using input function to input monthly income and assign it to a variable. There are 3 different kinds of 
           relationships between tax and monthly income, using boolean expressions and compute taxes seperately 
           depending on different kinds of monthly income according to different formula of tax and income.

VG-squarecolor.py: Using input function to input a chess square identifier and assign it to a variable, indexing 
                   the variable's two characters and assign them to other two variables seperately. According to 
                   the chessboard, if the first character is "b" or "d" or "f" or "h", when the second number is 
                   even, the square is black, otherwise, is white; if If the first character is "a" or "c" or "e" 
                   or "g", when the second number is odd, the square is white, otherwise, is black. Using boolean 
                   expression and integer modulus to identify what the color of square is and finally print it.
