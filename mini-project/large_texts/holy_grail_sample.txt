    I have come to take y--  Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
HERBERT:  You got my note!
LAUNCELOT:  Uh, well, I-- I got a-- a note.
HERBERT:  You've come to rescue me!
LAUNCELOT:  Uh, well, no.  You see, I hadn't--
HERBERT:  I knew someone would.  I knew that somewhere out there... 
    [music]
LAUNCELOT:  Well, I--
HERBERT:  ...there must be... someone...
FATHER:  Stop that!  Stop that!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Who are you?
HERBERT:  I'm your son!
FATHER:  No, not you.
LAUNCELOT:  Uh, I am Sir Launcelot, sir.
HERBERT:  He's come to rescue me, Father.
LAUNCELOT:  Well, let's not jump to conclusions.
FATHER:  Did you kill all those guards?
LAUNCELOT:  Uh...  Oh, yes.  Sorry.
FATHER:  They cost fifty pounds each!
LAUNCELOT:  Well, I'm awfully sorry.  Um, I really can explain everything.
HERBERT:  Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot.  I've got a rope all ready.
FATHER:  You killed eight wedding guests in all!
LAUNCELOT:  Well, uh, you see, the thing is, I thought your son was a lady.
FATHER:  I can understand that.
HERBERT:  Hurry, Sir Launcelot!  Hurry!
FATHER:  Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father, that's all!
LAUNCELOT:  Well, I really didn't mean to...
FATHER:  Didn't mean to?!  You put your sword right through his head!
LAUNCELOT:  Oh, dear.  Is he all right?
FATHER:  You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost me a
    fortune!
LAUNCELOT:  Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north from
    Camelot, when I got this note, you see--
FATHER:  Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot?
HERBERT:  Hurry, Sir Launcelot!
LAUNCELOT:  Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.
FATHER:  Very nice castle, Camelot.  Uh, very good pig country...
LAUNCELOT:  Is it?
HERBERT:  Hurry!  I'm ready!
FATHER:  Would you, uh, like to come and have a drink?
LAUNCELOT:  Well, that-- that's, uh, awfully nice of you,...
HERBERT:  I am ready!
LAUNCELOT:  ...um, I mean to be so understanding.
    [thonk]
    Um,...
    [woosh]
HERBERT:  Oooh!
LAUNCELOT:  ...I'm afraid when I'm in this idiom, I sometimes get a bit, uh,
    sort of carried away.
FATHER:  Oh, don't worry about that.
HERBERT:  Oooh!
